PARALLEL-package (beta 4) -- typesetting two texts parallel
===========================================================


What is it
-----------

The PARALLEL-package provides a small tool to typeset in two columns
or on two pages parallel, e.g. if you want to set two languages besides.

Please remember: this is only an ``interim-public-beta'' until I'll 
have finished the complete documentation, the code should be fine.
