\tcbsection{Support for Student Personal and Academic Growth}

\subsection{C1 Student Connectedness}

\subsubsection{Adequate Personalized Support}

\indicator{The school has available adequate services, including referral services, to support all students in such areas as health, career and personal counseling, and academic assistance.}

\prompt{Evaluate the availability and the adequacy of services, including referral services, to support students in such areas as health, career and personal counseling, and academic assistance.}

\begin{findings}
All seniors are enrolled in Senior Seminar to ensure they have information on graduation requirements, coaching on assembling application portfolios, and choosing target colleges to which they will submit applications.

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_1_a.jpg}}

Free after school academic assistance is available grades 3 - 12 on campus throughout the school year. This program allows high school students to earn required community service hours and provides effective peer tutoring for students.  \href{http://blogs.cmis.ac.th/newsletter/2015/09/17/einstein-eagles-starts-monday-get-involved/}{Einstein Eagles Homework Club} is one example of this assistance.

Academic Lab is available to all secondary students on an as-needed basis as well as for students whose need is through regular review of earned grades. A teacher is assigned duty in this room to assist with organization, review assignments, and oversee individualized computer-based foundational skills to all at-risk students. High school students with identified learning needs and English Language learners are placed in a semester-long foundational course called \href{https://drive.google.com/open?id=100aj_4W2p7cnSRhdpkEhTtGRoBIBMe6Uy8JgKBVyofk}{Writing With Style} in order to provide academic assistance. A biweekly review of all MS/HS grades in PowerSchool is done with Department Administrator oversight.

Elementary teachers identify students with specific learning needs through classroom work and DRA reading assessments done twice each school year. Intervention strategies are recommended and implemented in a program of tiered support designed to help teachers differentiate lessons and provide adequate academic assistance that affords all students opportunities to access and meet learning skills and standards. Examples of these are DRA, Strategies and Resources Guide, Elementary ESL teaching in small groups in and out of the classroom, instructional aides assist with teaching in small groups, 1:1 and whole class learning activities in grades pre K - 3, interning student teachers assist with teaching in small groups, 1:1 and whole class learning activities in grades 4 - 5. 

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_1_b.jpg}}

Individual and group personal counselling sessions are available at all grade levels through the ES, MS and HS counselors. The elementary school counselor visits each class twice monthly to provide support of school wide behavior norms and expectations in our Virtues program and PBIS elementary system; the middle school counselor teaches weekly Wellness classes that address issues of personal development, academic readiness and study skills, community service activities; the high school counselor maintains daily office hours for drop-in and scheduled personal and college/career counselling services, use of the Overgrad planning system for all high school students, reviews all high school students’ schedules to ensure graduation requirements are met and oversees the Senior Seminar class. CMIS also offers a course planning \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/16eIB9M_ucfMOXqUCxWzIenWzrnKBg2kegjcK8XHlTqI/edit#heading=h.6sft8ugn206j}{handbook}, college visits, college fair days on and off campus, a Korean parents information night and the \href{http://cmis.ac.th/}{School website}.

\begin{itemize}
\item The \href{https://sites.google.com/a/cmis.ac.th/cmis-health-office/home}{CMIS Health Office} implements and communicates school wide wellness initiatives such as immunizations.
\item Provides first aid and emergency care for students in need and first aid cover for extra-curricular activities.
\item Manages communicable diseases within the school and coordinates school response. 
\item Provides annual Health Checks including vision testing, scoliosis exams, weight and height recording. 
\item Reviews health and safety policies and procedures school wide, and manages recording of accidents
\item Oversees cafeteria menu and standards 
\item Tests water quality and manages control of mosquito population. 
\item Manages emergency procedures including fire, evacuation and lockdown drills.
\item Gathers medical information and immunization records for all students and manages students with chronic diseases and allergies through Individualised health-care plans.
\item Provides teachers with health alerts for students with health needs via Powerschool
\item Provides first aid and CPR training to staff and students and provides health-related lessons to elementary school.
\end{itemize}
 
English Language Learners are identified with a standardized test (WIDA) administered on entrance and at the start and end of each school year (WIDA-MODEL) until they are able to demonstrate near-mastery levels of English in the four strands of speaking, listening, reading and writing.  Qualified ESL teachers provide segregated small group skills teaching in pull-out classes as needed as well as in-class assistance and scaffolding for students in grades K-12 so that all students have access to and are able to make progress in our curriculum. The \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j2Z1tLgRgfX9CH3dzoYtU_GOhPOVWKPl6iFlvWqd6wM/edit}{fee schedule} for this support has been changed so that there is a one-time fee paid in a student’s first year at CMIS and all Student Services, including English language supports, are offered at no cost from a student’s second year in our school in order to more effectively provide universally available academic assistance. 

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_1_c.jpg}}

\href{http://blogs.cmis.ac.th/eagles/faith-service/spiritual-life/}{Spiritual Advisor} position is a paid, full-time position established to implement programs such as \href{http://blogs.cmis.ac.th/eagles/faith-service/spiritual-life/}{Weekly Bible Study Groups}. These programs are open to students of all faiths and address the school’s focus on Christian values and virtues.

\minor{So what...}

CMIS provides a range of support services to serve diverse community and student needs but because not all needs.
\end{findings}

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter4_C1_p1.jpg}}

\subsubsection{School Support Systems}

\indicator{The school coordinates a system of support services that provides for maximum effectiveness, including the processes for intervention and referral. }

\prompt{Is the level of school coordination of the system of support services allowing for maximum effectiveness? Are the processes for intervention or referral effective?}

\begin{findings}
The Student Services Coordinator position was created in 2015 to oversee admissions, identification, referrals, interventions and support services for all students, grades preK -12.

CMIS uses a norm-referenced standardized assessment tool (WIDA) with all student applicants to identify incoming students who may need English language support, learning support services and to monitor program’s effectiveness through regular re-assessments.
 
{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_1_d.jpg}}

We have developed a ‘teacher toolkit’ of applicable classroom interventions such as differentiation techniques, accommodations that promote universal planning, adaptive skills practice, and behavior management protocols. The Student Success Team has also developed a tracking sheet to help teachers identify struggling students and implement intervention strategies in the classroom. Finally, a services flow chart was designed to identify and address student needs.

\minor{So what...}

CMIS has resources available to help teachers more successfully address diverse learners, but teachers need to be made aware of these resources and coaching in the implementation of the resources in their classroom.
\end{findings}

\subsubsection{Strategies Used for Student Growth/Development}

\indicator{Strategies are used by the school leadership and staff to develop personalized approaches to learning and alternative instructional options which allow access to and progress in the rigorous standards-based curriculum. Examples of strategies include: level of teacher involvement with all students, a curriculum that promotes inclusion, processes for regular review of student and schoolwide profiles, and processes and procedures for interventions that address retention and redirection.}

\prompt{Evaluate the effectiveness of the types of strategies used by the school leadership and staff to develop personalized approaches to learning and alternative instructional options which allow access to and progress in the rigorous standards-based curriculum.}

\begin{findings}
High school students who need a personalized course of study to earn credits required for graduation may pursue independent study options that include coaching athletic teams, online courses with US accredited programs or may propose other \href{http://www.ck12.org/}{alternative instructional options}. Students with non-standard academic backgrounds, such as children of missionary families who have been home-schooled, are provided with support to scaffold their access to and progress in our rigorous, standards-based curriculum through programs such as \href{http://www.wilsonlanguage.com/programs/wilson-reading-system/}{Wilson Reading}, \href{https://www.readnaturally.com/}{Read Naturally} or other online curricula.

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_1_e.jpg}}

All students, including those with identified learning needs and English Language Learners, are placed in general classrooms to the greatest possible extent in order to ensure access to and measurable progress in our standards-based curriculum. Exceptional learners with diagnosed, documented learning needs are placed on a \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B_rFN7xA3AUNdlVaY2E1WGo1bUE}{Student Support Plan}, a \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B_rFN7xA3AUNdlVaY2E1WGo1bUE}{504 Accommodations Plan} or an \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B_rFN7xA3AUNdlVaY2E1WGo1bUE}{Individualized Education Plan} that follow US standards, so that such students can receive Learning Support services if they move to another school or be granted accommodations when taking the SAT or AP examinations. 

Effectiveness is measured by regular reviews of student grades, teacher reports and student self-evaluations.

\minor{So what...}

All CMIS students are challenged to work to their best ability in the general school population but given support as needed but not all staff are aware of all of these options.
\end{findings}

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter4_C1_p2.jpg}}

\subsubsection{Support Services and Learning}

\indicator{The school leadership and staff ensure that the support services and related activities have a direct relationship to student involvement in learning, e.g., within and outside the classroom, for all students.}

\prompt{Evaluate the extent to which the school leadership and staff ensure that the support services and related activities have a direct relationship to student involvement in learning, e.g., within and outside the classroom. Evaluate the processes that are used to identify under-performing or struggling students and the interventions to address these identified student learning needs.}

\begin{findings}
All support services, including learning support, counselling services and ESL teaching, provide instruction that is linked to teaching and learning standards used in students’ classrooms and Co-curricular activities. All support services are meant to address clearly identified learning needs and reinforce the values of the \href{http://cmis.ac.th/about/vision}{School Mission Statement}. 

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_1_f.jpg}}

Students are identified and referred by evaluation of grades, scores on standardized placement tests (WIDA) and teacher evaluations (Power School comments and grades).  Interventions for English Language Learners, struggling or under-performing and gifted students are collaboratively agreed on by teachers, family and school support staff and tailored to address individual needs. Regular progress reports evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and are shared with the teacher, family and student to assess progress and refine instruction and intervention strategies to better address need.

\minor{So what...}

Though CMIS identifies and provides services for our diverse student population, structures should be developed to more effectively communicate student progress to teachers and parents. 
\end{findings}

\subsubsection{Co-Curricular Activities}

\indicator{School leadership and staff link curricular and co-curricular activities to the academic standards and schoolwide learner outcomes, i.e., global competencies. Students have the opportunity to communicate with diverse audiences locally and worldwide. Students contribute to local and/or global actions and service opportunities.}

\prompt{Evaluate the extent of the availability and link of curricular and co-curricular activities for all students to the academic standards and schoolwide learner outcomes, i.e., the global competencies. How effective are these efforts?}

\begin{findings}
\minor{Background and Timeline on the Development of Student Life at CMIS}

\minor{So what...}

CMIS offers a wide variety of extracurricular activities that are closely linked to schoolwide learning outcomes for all levels (K-12) but these ECAs could be more closely linked to academic standards and participation in sports activities should be more closely linked to GPA requirements.
\end{findings}

\subsubsection{Student Involvement in Curricular/Co-Curricular Activities}

\indicator{The school has an effective process for regularly evaluating the level of student involvement in curricular/co-curricular activities and student use of support services. This includes students involved in projects on global issues, joining networks, and exchanges.}

\prompt{Comment on the effectiveness of the school process for regularly evaluating the level of student involvement in curricular/co-curricular activities and student use of support services.}

\begin{findings}
\minor{Student Involvement in Curricular Activities}

CMIS has processes in place to regularly evaluate the level of student involvement in curricular activities.  Each of these curricular activities has a formalized process for student selection and participation:

\begin{itemize}
\item Graduation
\item Honor Society Selection Process
\item PTG Senior Scholarship Application Process
\item HS Awards Evening and MS Awards Assembly
\item ES Bridging Ceremony
\end{itemize}

\minor{Student Involvement in Co-Curricular Activities}

CMIS has processes in place to regularly evaluate the level of student involvement in co-curricular activities.  Each of these co-curricular activities has a formalized process for student selection and participation.

\begin{itemize}
\item Clubs/Activities

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\minor{Student Use of Support Services}

CMIS has processes in place to regularly evaluate the level of student use of support services.  Each of these support services has a formalized process for evaluating student use.

\minor{So what...}

CMIS offers a wide range of services but needs to institute a means of monitoring the school community’s level of knowledge about and satisfaction with those services.
\end{findings}

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter4_c1_p3.jpg}}

\subsubsection{Student Perceptions}

\indicator{The school is aware of the student view of student support services through such approaches as interviewing and dialoguing with student representatives of the school population.}

\prompt{Comment on the student view of student support services after interviewing and dialoguing with student representatives of the school population.}

\begin{findings}
Students participated in a survey and results showed that they are generally aware that services such as tutoring, extracurricular activities, sports, community service and counselling are available but are not uniformly confident about who the services are for and when they are able to access those services.

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_1_g.jpg}}

\minor{So what...}

CMIS offers a range of services but needs to regularly remind the school community of what services are available through means such as wider advertising of available services through the school website, PTG meetings, weekly principal’s communications with teachers and an information sheet made available in the counsellor’s office and new student information pack
\end{findings}

\subsection{C2 Parent/Community Involvement}

\subsubsection{Regular Parent Involvement}

\indicator{The school implements strategies and processes for the regular involvement of parents and the community, including being active partners in the learning/teaching process for all programs. The school involves non-English speaking parents and/or online parents.}

\prompt{Evaluate the strategies and processes for the regular involvement of parents and the community, including being active partners in the teaching/learning process. Comment on the effectiveness of involving non-English speaking parents and/or online parents.}

\begin{findings}
CMIS implements strategies and processes for the regular involvement of parents and the community as active partners in the learning/teaching processes.

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_2_a.jpg}}

CMIS strives to provide communication in English, Thai, and Korean for our parent communities and important correspondence is often translated into all three languages.  In 2015, a CMIS community member volunteered their time to be a liaison for the Korean parent community.  Because of the value of this experience, administration hired a part-time Korean Liaison position for the 2016-2017 academic year.

The \href{http://blogs.cmis.ac.th/ptg/}{CMIS parent community} is regularly involved in learning activities on campus, including hosting cultural booths at International Day, being coaches for athletics teams, supporting athletics, drama, and music through “booster clubs”, attending Love and Logic workshops, and attending Family Teacher Conferences.

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_2_b.jpg}}

In the digital realm, parents are participants in the learning of their sons/daughters through the \href{https://cmis.powerschool.com/public/}{PowerSchool parent portal} and the use of classroom blogs and websites.

\minor{So what...}

CMIS parents and families can join the library, prayer groups, a drama boosters club, and after school music groups in addition to our active Parent Teachers Group but we need to better involve parents in child’s learning so that they feel informed about our standards and expectations.
\end{findings}

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter4_C2_p1.jpg}}

\subsubsection{Use of Community Resources}

\indicator{ The school uses community resources of the host country to support students such as professional services, partnerships, speakers, etc.}

\prompt{How effective is the school use of community resources to support students?}

\begin{findings}
CMIS uses community resources of the host country to support students. CMIS maintains a current listing of \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B_rFN7xA3AUNTC0yaWxCMEVYTkE}{service providers} for students and families, focused on therapeutic treatments and services for emotional, behavioral, and physical issues.

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_2_c.jpg}}

When appropriate, CMIS invites outside people and organizations to be a part of school curricular and co-curricular events and activities.  Local Rotary club members were invited to be judges for National History Day.  The local Education USA office attends Senior Seminar classes in first semester to support grade 12 students with their college applications. Our \href{http://blogs.cmis.ac.th/ptg/}{PTG} is another means of community outreach and communication. 

{\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_3_1_h.jpg}}

CMIS has many important institutional relationships that support student learning.  As a subsidiary of the Church of Christ of Thailand (CCT), CMIS is able to maintain positive relationships with sister organizations within CCT, including local Thai schools and universities, hospitals, and charitable organizations including a Christmas Gift Drive and support of Hope House, a local orphanage.  Similarly, as the school of choice for U.S. Consulate families and school for various other countries’ consular families, CMIS is able to provide unique opportunities for students to support their learning.

\minor{So what...}

CMIS students are exposed to opportunities to demonstrate Christian values and practice college-readiness skills but maintaining and expanding relationships within the larger Chiang Mai community will create more opportunities for students to develop their strengths
\end{findings}
