\section{CMIS: The School and the Community}
Chiang Mai International School (CMIS) is located just outside the old city of Chiang Mai, within the boundaries of the Superhighway. Chiang Mai is the largest significant city in Northern Thailand, and the former capital of the Lanna kingdom.  

Founded in 1296 AD, Chiang Mai is a growing city with a unique balance of modern conveniences and historic culture.  It is located in the northern region of Thailand, approximately 720 km from Bangkok.  Chiang Mai covers an area of 20,170 sq. km. and supports a population of 1,682,164 (based on June 2015 data).  It is a predominantly agricultural area with a well-established manufacturing and service-based economy.  Because of the rich culture, pleasant climate, stable economy, and friendly, relaxed atmosphere, Chiang Mai attracts many expats.  Tourism is one of the major industries, attracting more than 2 million foreign visitors annually.  The area also supports local and international businesses, NGOs, and mission organizations, which employ foreign professionals.

Our school, the first international school in Thailand outside of Bangkok, has a long and provincial history.  Our campus is a testament of this history!  From the beginning as an American Presbyterian missionary residence, to now as a 21st century school campus, the land on which CMIS sits has continually developed is a living and learning community with a strong sense of identity and a vision of educational excellence.  

Missionaries returning to work with the Church of Christ in Thailand (CCT) after World War II established a school for their children in Chiang Mai.  When CMIS was founded in 1954, the school was originally established in the McGilvary house (located on the First Church property along the Ping River).  Classes began with eight students on June 1, 1954.  In 1958, construction began on the present campus for the “Chiang Mai Children’s Center”.   Student numbers grew as more expatriate families seeking an English-language education for their children moved to Chiang Mai.

In 1984, representatives of the Thai Foreign Ministry and the CCT agreed that the formal establishment of an international school in Chiang Mai was a necessary step to achieving the school’s legal status.  Classes began in September 1985 for Kindergarten to Grade 8 under the new name “Chiang Mai International School” (CMIS).  High school grades were progressively added from 1992 to 1995.  

Our current campus is located in close proximity to private Thai schools, a hospital, a seminary and a university, all of which were founded by American Presbyterian missionaries and owned by the CCT.  The existing buildings on the CMIS campus, and their history of construction, are as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item McKean House (Administration Building) (1906)
\item Pre-School Building (1958)
\item Library Building (1958)
\item Auditorium Building (1988)
\item High School Building (1990)
\item Elementary Building (1997)
\item Gymnasium Building (2007)
\end{enumerate}
Today CMIS is a dynamic international school with over 500 students, but is it is still small enough to retain a friendly and relaxed campus environment.  It also remains true to the traditions of its founders, serving missionary families and maintaining the heritage and values of the Christian faith at the heart of the school, while welcoming children of all faiths, cultures, and ethnic backgrounds from the growing international community in Chiang Mai.  

Of the five main international schools in Chiang Mai, CMIS is the only one in close proximity to the center of the city.  With the growth potential promised by the ASEAN agreement, CMIS has looked toward expanding the current campus to meet the needs of the community while maintaining its characteristic close family atmosphere.  Short and long term campus development planning have been a huge focus for the past six years. There is now a long term plan that includes additional buildings and planned renovations to existing buildings.  The timeline for development began in July 2014, and actual construction began in April 2016.  Construction of a new high school building, a covered court, a new library and cafeteria, and swimming pool are expected to be completed by December 2018.  Campus Development Timeline.  There are ongoing renovation and enhancement projects to maintain the school grounds and existing facilities.   Campus Development Renovation.   CMIS Campus Development.

\section{Enrollment Patterns}

Overall student enrollment has increased incrementally by 10 to 20 students per year over the past five academic years.  More than half of the increase came through filling existing vacancies in the Elementary School.  While the Elementary grew at an average rate of 6\% per year, total school enrollment increased by only 2\% per year.  Prior to 2012, Grade 6 was classified as Elementary, whereas from 2013 to present, Grade 6 is classified as Middle School.  Despite the categorical change, Middle School enrollment actually declined slightly throughout the reporting period.  In the 2016-2017 academic year, total school enrollment surpassed 500 for the first time in history.

\placeholder{Enrollment 2012-2016 graphs and data}

\section{Student Diversity}

The CMIS student body represents a diverse international community, with students from over 30 different countries.  The largest single group are those who have dual passport status or parents from two different countries.  Many factors are taken into consideration when selecting our CMIS students.  Age, gender, and nationality are certainly among them.  However, academic potential, the ability to follow instructions, personal maturity, social skills, and overall potential to succeed are of greater importance.  Regardless of nationality or ethnic identity, all successful applicants must be qualified personally, socially, and academically.  

We give priority enrollment to qualified applicants from the Western world.  There are no restrictions placed on our dual citizens or those coming from Western countries, such as the United States, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and English-speaking countries in Europe or Asia.  We do not make exceptions for our missionary or diplomatic communities, but we do reserve spaces for them and give them priority for acceptance, if qualified.  In the 2016-2017 academic year, the percentage of American, Australian, Canadian, Dual, and United Kingdom students is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item American = 117 (23\%)
\item Australian / New Zealander 21 (4\%)
\item Canadian 8 (2\%)
\item Dual (\%)
\item United Kingdom 26 (5\%)
\end{itemize}

Thai, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese applicants are considered on a space-available basis.  Our target goals for each of these populations compared to our current enrollment are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Thai 25\% = 183 (36\%)
\item Korean 20\% = 75 (15\%)
\item Chinese 10\% = 24 (5\%)
\end{itemize}

\section{Criteria for Admission of Students}

\subsection{Standards for Entry}

CMIS strives to maintain a balanced, harmonious international environment where English is the language of inclusion.  We welcome applications from international students who:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Qualify academically (as determined by school records and standardized entrance assessment results) and
\item Meet the required English-language proficiency expectations for their grade level (as determined by CMIS guidelines).  
\end{enumerate}
CMIS strives to keep class sizes small, and thus provide the individualized, differentiated instruction that is needed to help each student succeed.  

Application to CMIS is competitive, and all students must have a minimum level of English language proficiency before they can be considered for enrollment.  The primary conditions for acceptance are academic eligibility, English-language proficiency, and exemplary behavior.  As part of the application process, applicants must submit copies of the current and previous year’s grade reports with teachers' comments, and any relevant standardized test results.  We can accept a limited number of academically qualified non-native English speakers, provided that their English-language proficiency falls within the CMIS guidelines for English as a Second Language (ESL) or English for Academic Purposes (EAP).  We can also accept a limited number for students with mild-to-moderate learning disabilities (as determined by previous school records, standardized testing, and Individualized Educational Plans), provided their disability falls within the CMIS guidelines for Learning Support (LS) and there is space available.

CMIS offers a Pre-School program for 4-year-old children who have reached their 4th birthday before the start of school in August.  The age / grade standard is set accordingly throughout elementary; age 5 for entry into Kindergarten, age 6 for grade 1, etc.  All applicants for Pre-School through Gr. 5 must have passed their required birth day by the start of school in August.  Students with birth dates after the start of school in August are classified according to their age at the time of enrollment, thus, any single CMIS grade level may have as much as 11 months of variability in the age of the students.  

For students who apply for entry to Middle School, applicants must have successfully completed the previous academic level and be within the appropriate age range for entry.  The age / grade level standard is adhered to as closely as possible, although an otherwise qualified applicant would rarely be asked to repeat a grade level that has been successfully completed in a comparable academic system.  Transferring into CMIS High School is dependent upon the number of credits on the student's transcript, compared to the CMIS graduation requirements.

Although we expect to have annual vacancies at each grade level, we reserve spaces for qualified, priority applicants.  Our Priority Categories are as follows: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Christian Missionary families,
\item Diplomatic / Consular families,
\item NGO / Non-profit organization families,
\item Siblings of current CMIS students, and
\item Former CMIS families who are returning from abroad
\item CMIS Staff children
\item All other applicants are considered on a space-available basis.
\end{itemize}

CMIS uses the Early Screening Inventory (ESI) for assessing Pre-School and Kindergarten applicants.  The test is scaled for children 3 years and 6 months old to 6 years 11 months.  Applicants for entry into Grades 1 through 11 are assessed with the WIDA (World-class Instructional Design and Assessment) to determine English-language proficiency.  The WIDA is divided into four grade level clusters:

\begin{itemize}
\item Grades 1 - 2
\item Grades 3 - 5
\item Grades 6 - 8
\item Grades 9 - 12
\end{itemize}

Each form of the WIDA assesses the four language domains of Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing.  

\subsection{Admissions Committee Review Process}

The CMIS Admissions Committee is responsible for making all decisions regarding student applications. The Committee consists of the Admissions Director, School Superintendent, Dean of Students, Elementary Principal, Elementary Counselor, Middle School Counselor, and High School Counselor.    Learning Support Specialists serve as adjunct members of the Committee, and may be asked to comment, provide additional assessment, or recommend further testing.  

In their assessment of an application, the Committee takes the following information into account:

\begin{itemize}
\item applicant's profile
\item previous academic background
\item performance on CMIS entrance assessment
\item English-language ability
\item availability of space at the recommended grade level / support program”
\end{itemize}

In brief, applicants are expected to:

\begin{itemize}
\item qualify academically (above average grades in a comparable academic system)
\item meet the English-language proficiency expectations for their grade level
\item fit into a CMIS priority category or add value to our CMIS community
\item be able to succeed academically without ESL or LS, or fit our criteria to qualify for those support programs
\item meet behavioral and social expectations of the CMIS student body
\end{itemize}

 The Committee determines the applicants’ qualifications for each criteria by:

\begin{itemize}
\item reviewing academic records (minimum of 2 years, as appropriate) and standardized test results
\item conducting entrance assessments
\item reviewing psychologists' assessments or other supporting documentation
\item meetings with the applicant and family
\item reviewing letters of recommendation
\end{itemize}

CMIS uses Open Apply, an online application system.  Applicants and enquirers are encouraged to register their interest, schedule an appointment for a meeting with the Admissions Director, and to complete their application electronically.  

Newly admitted students’ families are given a New Family Survey to help identify areas we need to focus; both in terms of the student application process and advertising. We use this data to refine how we reach our target audience and provide a better experience for our new families.

\section{Student Post-Graduation Plans}

CMIS graduates gain admission to colleges and universities around the world, with many electing to study in North America.

\placeholder{Teacher and Admin Qualifications}

\section{Staff Professional Development}

CMIS is committed to providing and supporting professional development opportunities for its full-time teachers to improve teaching and student learning. This commitment is grounded in the belief that professional development is a continuous process, one which may be individualized depending on the skills and needs of the teacher for the purpose of benefiting the teacher, CMIS and its students.  

The quality of our Teachers has been identified as the main factor in attracting new students to CMIS.  Recognizing that, CMIS provides teachers and staff with high quality professional development opportunities, both internally and externally.  The school provides funding in the amount of 10,000 Baht for each school year, for each full-time teacher to engage in professional development opportunities for the purpose of benefiting the teacher, CMIS and its students.  

PD funds can be accrued up to 5 years. Any (projected) unspent amount will be returned to the general PD fund at the end of the 5-year period or earlier if the teacher leaves CMIS employment.

The PD budget may be used toward professional development (PD) recertification, workshops, conferences, professional memberships, or position-specific training.   Travel, per diem, accommodation, registration, tuition, and required materials are also eligible for reimbursement, based on established guidelines.  Transportation budgets are limited, and staff are encouraged to look for PD opportunities within the region.  

All professional development funding and leave must be approved by the divisional principal, superintendent, or director.  CMIS believes that professional development is a continuous process, which may be individualized depending on the skills and needs of the teacher in the support of student learning. Any professional development opportunity should be related to schoolwide, student learning focus. 

All applications for professional development are considered carefully based on the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Location of the event with priority set in the order of Chiang Mai, Thailand, SE Asia, outside of SE Asia, as well as if the course or seminar is offered online.
\item Relevance to the school wide, student learning focus.
\item Benefit to CMIS.
\item Length of time away from school.
\item Budget availability (early application is best for this).
\item Timing of request, advanced notice is preferred.
\item Staff member’s seniority or stated plans to stay at CMIS.
\end{enumerate}
	
CMIS promotes the continued professional development of its teachers in the following ways:


\begin{enumerate}
\item Advanced Placement (AP) Training.  
\item Chiang Mai based Conferences and Seminars. 
\item Online courses and seminars.  
\item Conferences and seminars held in Thailand. 
\item EARCOS Conference.
\item Out-of-country conferences and seminars. 
\item Sharing the Experience.  Upon the staff member’s return to school, he or she is expected to share with the school what was learned.  This will be arranged with the Superintendent/school Principal and a time set at an appropriate meeting to share.  Staff members will also file a written assessment of the program through the Professional Development Assessment Form that will be made available for the staff to review.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Parent Teacher Group}
Teachers, administrators and parents or guardians of CMIS students are all automatically members of the Parent Teacher Group (PTG). The PTG is your "voice" at CMIS, as it provides a forum for sharing ideas and concerns about our school, and creates opportunities for you to establish friendships and networks within the CMIS community. The primary objectives of the PTG are:
\begin{itemize}
\item To promote communication between CMIS parents, teachers and administrative staff.
\item To promote and actively support CMIS educational programs, sports, activities and events. 
\end{itemize}
We achieve this through volunteer work and fundraising.  The PTG welcomes and encourages all parents and teachers to take an active role in the school. You may do this by attending our monthly meetings, and by volunteering your time, resources and abilities to make CMIS the best place that it can be - for the sake of our children and their education.

\section{School Executive Team}

The school executive team (SET) is made up of the director, manager, and superintendent. The SET is responsible for implementing the school vision and mission, and serving as a bridge between the Board and the school.  They meet weekly to make high level decisions affecting school policies and procedures. SET, as members of the school board, ??? and raise issues to the school board

\item[CMIS Manager] Patcharin Jingkaojai 
\item[CMIS Superintendent] Ronelda Capadona 
\item[PTG Representative] Pascal van Geest
\item[Teacher Representative] Brad Schmock
\end{description}
The Roles and Responsibilities of the Board are listed below:  (listed on page 9 of the Student Planner).
CMIS is owned by the Foundation of the Church of Christ in Thailand (CCT), and is operated through a Board of Directors comprised of a Board Chair (appointed by CCT); the CMIS School Executive Team; an elected representative from the PTG; an elected representative from the teaching staff; and additional members appointed by the CCT.

\minor{Strategic Planning and Thinking}
The Board of Directors develops and maintains the strategic plan for the school, guiding
decisions on the organizational level in terms of program, facilities, etc., while keeping in
mind the overall vision and mission of the school.

\minor{Setting Policy}
The Board of Directors oversees the development of policy for school operations. Hiring, evaluating and supporting of the School Leadership Team (Director, Manager and Superintendent) is a key responsibility of the Board. The Board of Directors is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the school, but supports the school leadership in developing the necessary skills and resources to run the school effectively.

\minor{Financial Stability}
The Board of Directors is responsible for the financial stability of the school and thus sets tuition rates and approves annual budgets.

\minor{How Does the Board Govern?}
The Board of Directors generally meets once a month from July through June.  Board members should be committed to attending every board meeting, but the board is also understanding of other constraints of members’ time.

\section{Teacher Administration Communication Team}

The purpose of the TACT is to foster and create the best learning environment possible for our students by improving the overall happiness and satisfaction of faculty. We believe that when we invest in the well being of people, we invest in the long term success and viability of CMIS.

To this end, the role of TACT is to provide a way for faculty to raise issues, concerns, and questions to the CMIS Executive Team (Director, Superintendent, Business Manager).  CMIS prefers that individuals address issues, concerns, and questions directly to their building administration (the principals of the elementary, middle, and high schools).  There are times, however, when individuals may not feel comfortable in speaking with building administration or leadership; thus TACT can forward these issues on their behalf.
\begin{itemize}
\item we believe in positive intentions, and that all stakeholders share the same vision of the best possible learning environment for CMIS students
\item we believe in openness and transparency in decision making and communications
\item we believe in equity - the fair and impartial treatment of others
\item we believe that praise and recognition produces far better results than criticism or punishment
\item we believe in social sustainability and social responsibility
\end{itemize}

The operation of TACT follows these policies, procedures, guidelines:

\minor{Privacy Policy}
\begin{itemize}
\item the identity of the person(s) bringing forth issues/questions/concerns is kept confidential, unless the person(s) so inform TACT they would like their name(s) to be known
\item the minutes and all other communications published by TACT are only to be shared with CMIS stakeholders (CMIS leadership, faculty, Board of Directors)
\item faculty are not required to put their name(s) on communications with TACT - though this may make it difficult for TACT to ask for clarification and lead to an issue/concern/question not being raised (clarification is often required and is confidential)
\end{itemize}

\minor{Meetings}
\begin{itemize}
\item TACT representatives endeavor to meet regularly, from September - May, with CMIS Executive Team (Director, Superintendent, Business Manager)
\item TACT representatives will plan and coordinate the date of the monthly meeting, usually for the last week of each month in the Superintendent's office
\end{itemize}

\minor{Communications Procedures and Policies}
\begin{itemize}
\item TACT will publish the minutes of the monthly meetings with leadership by informing faculty, leadership, and the Board of Directors of these minutes through email
\item TACT will inform faculty, at least one week in advance,  of any upcoming meetings with CMIS leadership and request input from faculty
\end{itemize}

\minor{Issues/Questions/Concerns (guidelines)}
\begin{itemize}
\item the issues/questions/concerns must be related to CMIS faculty (those holding a teacher's contract with CMIS)
\item faculty are encouraged to first raise issues/questions/concerns, where relevant, with their respective building administration, or with CMIS leadership directly, before requesting TACT assistance
\item the issues/questions/concerns must have an importance/relevance to many faculty
\item some issues/questions/concerns may not be forwarded by TACT if they have already been responded to by leadership
\item TACT questions, discussions and minutes must be issue-based.  Person-specific questions raised and publicly minuted in TACT notes are inappropriate and potentially hurtful. Issues/questions/concerns should be researched and understood and the goal would be to find solutions that benefit CMIS as an institution and learning environment.
\item issues/questions/concerns can be brought to TACT through these methods:
\begin{enumerate}
\item speaking with TACT rep for your division
\item dropping a note in the mailbox of your TACT rep
\item email your TACT rep directly
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\minor{Grievances}

When a faculty member has a grievance, either with another faculty member, leadership, etc. TACT can help facilitate the mediation process. There is an existing CMIS procedure and explanation for grievances detailed in the CMIS Faculty Handbook.

TACT representatives are familiar with the CMIS grievance procedure, and can help you by making sure these steps are followed. TACT reps role is not to participate in the procedure, rather just help to ensure the process is followed. This applies to both the informal and the formal procedures as outlined in the CMIS Faculty Handbook.

\minor{TACT Representatives - policies and procedures}
\begin{enumerate}
\item there are three TACT representatives, one at each division (elementary, middle, high)
\item before the end of May of each year, nominations are requested from the faculty in each division for the representative for that division for the following school year
\item for consistency and to carry forward knowledge, at least one member of  TACT must continue from one year to the next, thus nominations may not occur in all three divisions
\item the representatives from the previous year will oversee the nomination process for their respective divisions
\item the nomination process uses the following text, and can be run through email, at a faculty meeting, by paper ballot, a google docs form, or any other reliable and equitable method:
"I nominate\underline{          }the Teacher/Admin Communication Team representative for the  (division name) for the\underline{          }school year"
\end{enumerate}
