CMIS has a clear Vision, Mission and Student Learner Outcomes that reflect the beliefs and philosophy of the school. These are widely published and easily visible to the community. \href{http://cmis.ac.th/about/vision}{CMIS Vision and Mission} 

CMIS stakeholders strive to continuously uphold the mission of providing educational excellence, in a caring Christian community that celebrates and respects diversity. \href{https://docs.google.com/a/cmis.ac.th/presentation/d/1EJ3zT-xwUj2W--v5mTN6xWOqewtvhXrhTxXuoR1HyAg/edit?usp=sharing}{CMIS Mission Statement Project} 

The current version of our mission statement resulted from the work of a committee of board members, administrators, teachers, and parents in 2014-2015. Though recently updated, the CMIS mission is still aligned to the historical values of the school.

This year, our student learner outcomes posters displayed around campus were designed and created by our grade 6-12 students. Who We Are Student Poster Competition 

\minor{So what...}

CMIS has a clear Vision, Mission and Student Learner Outcomes that reflect the overall goal of the school community. These are continuously referred to and well known throughout the community. 

We need to find more opportunities to receive feedback from parents on the relevancy of our school “purpose” so we can remain confident that it reflects the beliefs and philosophy of the whole school and its constituency.

\subsubsection{Purpose, Schoolwide Learner Outcomes, and Profile Data}

\indicator{The student/community profile data and identified global competencies have impacted the development of the school’s vision, mission, and schoolwide learner outcomes.}

\prompt{Evaluate the degree to which the development of the school’s vision, mission, and schoolwide learner outcomes have been impacted by pertinent student/community profile data and identified global competencies, and current educational research}

\begin{findings}
Our community profile data has greatly impacted the development of the\href{http://cmis.ac.th/about/vision}{ CMIS’ Mission, Vision and Student Learning Outcomes Statement}:

Our \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bIbV9pgGz2vpXYJdnRzL_Od5PS35egy7lgBOBuszgD4/edit}{Student Learner Outcomes} (SLOs) were modified from their original format as Educational Objectives in 2015 to better recognize our diverse student population (32 different nationalities), embrace our global citizenship responsibilities, and include updated 21st century skills. These outcomes were reviewed with all students at the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year and their interpretations were displayed as posters across campus. \href{https://docs.google.com/a/cmis.ac.th/presentation/d/1bdi1LZUjWbGKOyB0XR9CGyoY2xLY39SZVKhiHTIJGxc/edit?usp=sharing}{Student Poster Competition}

Our diverse group of \href{http://www.cmis.ac.th/about/faculty}{highly qualified educators} originating from over 12 different countries reflect the different cultures and nationalities of our community. Our additional support staff positions also reflect our efforts to meet our community needs (examples: Korean liaison and student spiritual advisor)

CMIS addresses global competencies in a variety of ways beyond the school mission and SLOs. Academically, CMIS students are engaged in learning standards that are internationally benchmarked and rigorous. \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByVFfrm0zfolMVRQYmI1aGlRNDQ}{CMIS Teaching Standards K-12}

CMIS students have multiple opportunities to engage in school activities and events that require global understanding (e.g. \href{http://gallery.cmis.ac.th/zp-core/full-image.php?a=2010-2011/thai-day-2011/website&i=_mg_3802-version-2.jpg&q=100&wmk=\%21&dsp=Protected\%20view&check=788a1e55c231186711f8dcc0876f4efd0daa0880}{Thai Day}) celebration of diversity (\href{http://gallery.cmis.ac.th/zp-core/full-image.php?a=2013-2014/international_day&i=_MG_6129.jpg&q=100&wmk=\%21&dsp=Protected\%20view&check=788a1e55c231186711f8dcc0876f4efd0daa0880}{International Day}) sharing multiple perspectives (e.g. \href{https://www.nhd.org/}{National History Day}) and using multilingual skills (e.g. Model United Nations Club) 

We use globally recognized, research-based standardized tests to identify and assess student needs (e.g, DRA, MAPS, PSAT, and SAT). 

CMIS extra curricular activities (Student Life Beyond The Classroom) emphasize the development of critical thinking skills, the ability to solve problems, and the utilization of effective communication skills. \href{http://blogs.cmis.ac.th/eagles/}{Student Life Beyond the Classroom}

CMIS students participate in community service projects at all three divisions (ES, MS and HS) to promote responsibly in action and service to improve conditions both locally and globally Examples include Elementary School Thanksgiving Drive for Hope House (local orphanage), \href{https://drive.google.com/a/cmis.ac.th/file/d/0B7jcj1TRcFEGNEtqR3hUSW5QVHM/view?usp=sharing}{Middle School Activity Day} at Hope House and High School \href{http://blogs.cmis.ac.th/community-service/}{community service projects}.

\minor{So what...}

There are many ways in which our school can demonstrate how our vision, mission, and schoolwide learner outcomes have been impacted by pertinent student and community profile data, identified global competencies, and current educational research. 
As our student and community profile is constantly changing, we need to always ensure that we keep abreast of these changes and modify our goals accordingly.
