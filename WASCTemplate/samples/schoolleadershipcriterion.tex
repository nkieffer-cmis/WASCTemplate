\subsection{School Leadership Criterion}
The school leadership (1) makes decisions to facilitate actions that focus the energies of the school on student achievement of the schoolwide learner outcomes, i.e., global competencies, (2) empowers the staff, and (3) encourages commitment, participation, and shared accountability for student learning in a global environment.

\subsubsection{Defined Responsibilities, Practices, etc.}

\indicator{The school has administrator and faculty written policies, charts, and handbooks that define responsibilities, operational practices, decision-making processes, and relationships of leadership and staff.}

\prompt{Evaluate these administrator and faculty written policies, charts, and handbooks. Determine the clarity and understanding of these by administration and faculty.}

\begin{findings}
CMIS has clear policies that define responsibilities, operational practices, decision making processes and relationships of leadership and staff. 

These policies and procedures can be found in the CMIS employment contracts and the \href{https://drive.google.com/a/cmis.ac.th/file/d/0ByVFfrm0zfolVm9uc19UNl82NVpPMUZ1ZEstZlFidEY1c2hn/view?usp=sharing}{CMIS Faculty Handbook}. They are reviewed annually during the administrative, new teacher, and returning staff orientations. 

Furthermore, a list of administrative teams is included in the Faculty Handbook and CMIS Student Planner. 

CMIS organized ``\href{https://drive.google.com/a/cmis.ac.th/file/d/0ByVFfrm0zfolbHNvSWhVWmJYU3M/view?usp=sharing}{Teacher Table Talk}'' sessions during early release days to capture insights and suggestions about the decision-making processes and relationships of leadership and staff. 

In November, 2016 the \href{https://docs.google.com/a/cmis.ac.th/document/d/1iW_tWIwRlWU2p0oIOvd3usDsxj9qYDt_2ROwNPBTHSc/edit?usp=sharing}{Teacher Leadership Team}  which is made up of teachers and administrators, participated in the revision of the handbook format and made it available in an electronic formatted version. We plan to make this an annual project as it was previously revised only by administrators.

CMIS Board governance requires the Executive Team (i.e. Superintendent, Director and Manager) to maintain up-to-date operational handbooks and procedural guidelines.

Board member roles and responsibilities are clearly outlined and described in the \textit{Christian Churches of Thailand Board Handbook}.

\minor{So what...}

CMIS Leadership has clearly defined roles for teachers only through a variety of methods, most notably the Teacher Handbook. CMIS should continue to maintain, monitor, and modify, as necessary, the Teacher Handbook with stakeholder feedback and input. Additionally, CMIS should develop a Leadership Handbook to clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of principals, directors, and team leaders.
