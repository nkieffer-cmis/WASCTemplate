CMIS Leadership and teaching staff ensure congruence between the actual concepts and skills taught, the academic standards, and the schoolwide learner outcomes through a variety of methods. 

Much of the professional development and teacher work for the past two years has focused on unpacking the literacy standards as all teachers are responsible student success in reading, writing, and speaking/listening. As we focused on understanding the standards, certain structures were created to ensure fidelity to concepts/skills, standards, and SLOs. 

First, was the continuation of the Understanding by Design unit development initiative begun in 2013-2014. The traditional UbD template ensures that teacher/designers address in Stage 1: established goals, skills and knowledge, essential questions, and understandings. Stage 2: assessment, and Stage 3: learning plan. Though CMIS teachers used this general UbD template to ensure alignment with these essential, researched-based elements of UbD, a handful of modifications were added to the template to ensure congruence between our skills/knowledge, our adopted standards, and the SLOs; see Table below. 

Secondly, CMIS Leadership and Teaching Staff have implemented the Datawise Process. Using this process, CMIS has created school data teams of teachers and administrators who make use of performance data and other information to target educational questions to pursue, identify major gaps in student understanding, identify target areas called learner-centered problems (LCP), reframe learner-centered problems as problems of practice (POP), target solutions to problems of practice, and write action plans pinpointing how broadly solutions will be implemented, how they can be implemented and adapted across grade levels and content areas, and on what timelines they will be carried out. 

CMIS Leadership and Teaching Staff used 2014-2015 ISA data to develop a CMIS specific schoolwide LCP, created a schoolwide POP, each department created a strategy to address the POP, and assessed throughout the 2015-2016. Based upon teacher feedback and achievement data, the 2016-2017 year Datawise program was modified to allow each department to determine their LCP and POP based upon department specific data. The departments’ Datawise plan is currently being implemented. By using the Datawise process, the CMIS Leadership the Teaching Staff have ensured academic outcomes (i.e. standardized test data) are used to make instructional decisions that were based upon students’ skills/ concepts, and standards.
